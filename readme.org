* What is it?

Since at the moment scaling multimonitors at different dpis can be a bit troublesome, for now, sometimes one must scale per application.

This will let emacs switch between a high and low dpi mode, based on what monitor it sees it is on.

Works per frame also, so a frame on a low dpi monitor will not be scaled, while one on a high dpi monitor will.

* Bugs
1) Not everything seems to resize perfectly.



* How to install
Place somewhere, and then
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/extension")
(require 'auto-resize)
#+END_SRC
For example
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/auto-resize")
(require 'auto-resize)
#+END_SRC
* Custom Vars
The variables auto-resize--timer-value, and auto-resize--ppi-turning-point specify how often to check, and the ppi to check for.
