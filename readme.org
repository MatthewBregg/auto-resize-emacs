* What is it?

Since at the moment scaling multimonitors at different dpis can be a bit troublesome, for now, sometimes one must scale per application.

This will let emacs switch between a high and low dpi mode, based on what monitor it sees it is on.

Works per frame also, so a frame on a low dpi monitor will not be scaled, while one on a high dpi monitor will.

* Bugs
Used the window-configuration-change-hook, which is the best hook I could find, but still limited. 
Just moving does not rescale, need to do something to trigger the window-configuration-change-hook, like maximizing

* How to install
Place somewhere, and then
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/extension")
(require 'auto-resize)
#+END_SRC
For example
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/auto-resize")
(require 'auto-resize)
#+END_SRC
